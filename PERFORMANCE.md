# Performance Optimization Guide

## ðŸš€ Implemented Optimizations

### **Bundle Splitting & Lazy Loading**
- âœ… Lazy loaded non-critical components (About, Skills, Projects, etc.)
- âœ… Optimized Vite configuration with smart code splitting
- âœ… Separate chunks for Three.js, GSAP, and other heavy libraries

### **3D Scene Optimizations**
- âœ… Adaptive quality based on device capabilities
- âœ… Reduced particle counts during scrolling (100-800 particles)
- âœ… Lower geometry complexity on mobile (8-24 segments)
- âœ… Disabled post-processing effects on low-end devices
- âœ… Frame rate throttling for animations (15-30 fps instead of 60)

### **Canvas Performance**
- âœ… Disabled antialiasing for better performance
- âœ… Dynamic DPR scaling (0.5-1.5 based on scroll state)
- âœ… Frame loop set to 'demand' during scrolling
- âœ… Disabled stencil and depth buffers when not needed

### **Scroll Optimizations**
- âœ… Faster Lenis scroll duration (0.8s instead of 1.2s)
- âœ… Optimized scroll detection (100ms debounce)
- âœ… Reduced 3D scene complexity during scroll
- âœ… Simpler easing functions

## ðŸ“Š Performance Monitoring

### **Enable Debug Mode**
Add `?debug=true` to URL to show FPS counter and memory usage.

### **Expected Performance**
- **Desktop**: 60 FPS, smooth scrolling
- **Mobile**: 30-45 FPS, acceptable scrolling
- **Low-end devices**: 15-30 FPS, basic animations

## ðŸ”§ Further Optimizations (if needed)

### **If still slow on mobile:**
1. Reduce particle count further (50-200)
2. Disable floating shapes entirely
3. Use simpler materials (meshBasicMaterial)
4. Reduce star count (100-500)

### **If scroll is still laggy:**
1. Disable 3D scene entirely during scroll
2. Use CSS transforms instead of GSAP for simple animations
3. Implement intersection observer for section loading

## ðŸŽ¯ Performance Targets

- **First Contentful Paint**: < 2s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 3s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1
- **First Input Delay**: < 100ms
